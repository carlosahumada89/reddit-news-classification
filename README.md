# Reddit News Classification

## Introduction

Reddit is a social network which divides topics into so called ‘subreddits’. On these subreddits, users can upvote or down-vote each post. According to Reddit instructions: “[…]If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it”.

To test the text2vec R package, a dataset containing the title of the posts from 2008 to 2016 in the WorldNews subreddit obtained from kaggle will be used. For computational purposes, only the posts from 2016 will be taken into account.
